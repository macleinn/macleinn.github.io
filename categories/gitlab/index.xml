      <description>How do you know who you&amp;rsquo;re talking to is really the person you think you&amp;rsquo;re talking to? I came across Keybase recently and liked their way of securing chat messages between people on the internet. To verify the identity of people with whom you establish contact online, Keybase checks a selection of their online identities. (For more, check out https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat.) I digress. It reminded me that I have yet to set up a GPG key to sign my commits to public repositories.</description>
