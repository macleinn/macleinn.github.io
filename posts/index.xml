      <description>Part of the learning process is memorising. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s an artistic or scientific discipline, practice reinforces memory and strengthens understanding. Dance choreography, for example, requires practice to commit movements into muscle memory before it can be performed with precision and emotions.1 For some reason, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to learn CSS3 animation by showing dancer positions in Regency dances. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take me a while to take it to demo level so this will be covered over multiple entries.</description>

      <description>How do you know who you&amp;rsquo;re talking to is really the person you think you&amp;rsquo;re talking to? I came across Keybase recently and liked their way of securing chat messages between people on the internet. To verify the identity of people with whom you establish contact online, Keybase checks a selection of their online identities. (For more, check out https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat.) I digress. It reminded me that I have yet to set up a GPG key to sign my commits to public repositories.</description>

      <description>On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve of 2018, I decided to use Git to handle all my (non-private) note-keeping. My GitHub space was looking neglected (mainly because I rarely make my projects public) so I decided to freshen it up by using it to keep track of all my notes. There was another reason&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been hankering to try Hugo out. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember where I read about Hugo but it was around the same time I found out about Jekyll.</description>
