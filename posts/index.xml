      <description>How do you know who you&amp;rsquo;re talking to is really the person you think you&amp;rsquo;re talking to? I came across Keybase recently and liked their way of securing chat messages between people on the internet. To verify the identity of people with whom you establish contact online, Keybase checks a selection of their online identities. (For more, check out https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat.) I digress. It reminded me that I have yet to set up a GPG key to sign my commits to public repositories.</description>

There was another reason&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been hankering to try Hugo out. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember where I read about Hugo but it was around the same time I found out about Jekyll.</description>
